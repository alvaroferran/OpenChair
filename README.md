# OpenChair

With OpenChair we want to create the first wheelchair development platform in which users can code or design the adaptations necessary to fit their needs.

In order to do so, we modified a manual wheelchair to convert it into an electric one, designed highly customizable armrests and developed a controller board with BLE to allow users to build and control the wheelchair in the manner that best suits them.

For further information and build instructions, please check [this page](https://hackaday.io/project/13347-openchair).
